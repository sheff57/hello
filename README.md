# hello
a little about me
Whether it is spoons, bowels, boxes or books, I believe that everyone would want to, like to touch , use, own, something handmade, something crafted by hand every now and again. I believe that this, unlike the mass produced smooth plastic disposables, puts them in touch with, back in touch with, their humanity, humility, mortality.

It puts them in touch with me, and I with them.
